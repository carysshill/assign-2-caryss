          <div class="content">
            <p>I started playing ringette when I was in the third grade. I joined when I didn't even know how to skate, so I was way behind all my friends. Once I caught up with everyone, I started getting better. One season, we won all of our games, and we won an award for it. I have played on multiple teams. TORL was an AA team where I was an assistant captain, but we didn't do very well. Another team I was on was BCWG, which we ended up winning. They moved up and won provincials and got named Team BC, but COVID happened, so we didn't finish the season. Then, the next season after COVID, we won provincials again, got named Team BC again, and won Western Canadians. And then I had to quit to come to school, but I was possibly thinking about playing again here in Calgary.</p>

          <div class="title">About my Volleyball Career</div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>I don't know when I started volleyball, but I was very young. I was always playing volleyball with my sister and mom in the backyard. I joined the Sky volleyball club in Vernon, BC, but since I was super busy with Ringette, they wanted me to commit to one sport. I then chose Ringette because I love Ringette. But my whole ringette team still wanted to play volleyball, so we made our own club called the Firehawks, and we ended up playing ringette and volleyball just as we wanted. I eventually got sick of volleyball and quit the club two years ago. I did play school volleyball for my senior year, and we ended up winning provincials, and now we have a banner with our names on it in the high school gym forever, which is cool.</p>
